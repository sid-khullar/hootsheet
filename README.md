Hootsuite has a limit of 350 messages across networks. Becomes difficult to manage messaging with multiple networks, message lists for specific sets of networks etc. This script helps manage this sort of messaging.

Used with the Ad Inserter plugin for Wordpress. I use it to insert an ad after the first para of a blog post and wanted to randomise the image displayed.
