# hootsheet
Collates messages based on specified sheet, number of messages and starting date into separate sheets. Written to simplify the tedious job of creating multiple bulk sending CSV files for Hootsuite, especially if one has different combinations of target social networks for different message sets, and the limit of 350 messages is too small.

The script needs a config sheet where to read the message configuration, requires the entries under the 'Sheets' column to exist with the standard Hootsuite CSV format, and needs sheets named in the Tag column to exist.

The idea is to have a list of different content streams as source sheets, which can be added to over time.
